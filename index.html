                                    <p>LexJet’s thermal laminates provide high clarity, increased bond strength, superior resistance to abrasion, water, oil, acid and alkali and are perfect for high-production runs on bond inkjet paper, microporous-coated inkjet paper, electrostatic and continuous tone photographic prints.</p>

                                            <li>When thermal laminating, you want to use a dimensionally stable media</li>
                                            <li>Thermal laminates will not stick consistently to swellable coatings </li>
                                            <li>Thermal laminates work perfectly on any microporous coated paper/polyester</li>
                                            <li>Thermal laminates will work on hybrid coatings, but not as good as microporous</li>
                                            <li>Thermal laminates will work on macroporous coatings, but many macroporous coated products are not good to thermal laminate as they are vinyl</li>

                                    <p>A liquid laminate can be a great alternative to thermal or pressure sensitive adhesive and is effective for protecting digital prints, fine art, signs, banners and other products from the elements. Liquid laminates produce little waste and are extremely economical when machine-applied. The coating process offers as much or more UV-and abrasion-protection as film laminates. They also stretch and conform to uneven surfaces.</p>

Insufficient cure time can lead to poor bond strength, causing tunneling, delaminating, and edge lift.  We recommend allowing at least 2 hours for the adhesive to cure before trimming and rolling your graphics.  A full 24 hours of cure time will yield the best bond.</li>

A good way to know if the print is ready to be laminated is to make sure it is dry to the touch.  If the ink is still tacky, allow more dry time.  Printer manufacturers recommend waiting 24 hours.</li>

                                                    <li>It is important to allow ample time for your adhesives to cure before trimming and rolling your graphics.  Insufficient cure time can lead to poor bond strength, causing tunneling, delaminating, and edge lift.  We recommend allowing at least 2 hours for the adhesive to cure before trimming and rolling your graphics.  A full 24 hours of cure time will yield the best bond.</li>
